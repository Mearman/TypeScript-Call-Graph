# TypeScript Call Graph

This **CLI** will create an interactive graph of all the functions and their calls in the TypeScript files you provide.

‚ö†Ô∏è this is a work in progress üöß

## How to use

```sh
npm install -g typescript-call-graph
```

Inside any directory, run:

```sh
tcg
```

It will remind you how to use the CLI: you need to provide specific files, or globs:

```sh
tcg myFile.ts folder/**.ts anotherFolder/**.*.ts
```

## Developing

Clone repository. Edit `index.ts` and/or `extract.ts` and run `npm start` to build changes, `npm test` to run CLI against files in this repository.

Suggestions or PRs for how to improve this CLI are very welcome 	üôá
